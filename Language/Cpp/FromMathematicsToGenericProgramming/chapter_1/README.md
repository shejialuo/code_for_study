# Chapter 1 What This Book Is About

The book is about *generic programming*, an approach to programming
that was introduced in the 1980s.

*Definition 1.1. Generic programming* is an approach to programming that
focuses on designing algorithms and data structures so that they work in
the most general setting without loss of efficiency.

Generic programming itself is more of an *attitude* toward programming
than a particular set of tools.

## 1.1 Programming and Mathematics

Generic programming comes from mathematics, and especially from a branch
of mathematics called *abstract algebra*.

The abstractions that appear in abstract algebra largely come from concrete
results in one of the oldest branches of mathematics, called *number theory*.
